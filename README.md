```
You:    "Build me an expected goals model from shot data"
Claude: [loads xg-model-building skill → walks you through feature selection,
         spatial coordinates, shot type encoding, logistic regression baseline,
         gradient boosting upgrade, calibration, and evaluation]
```

```
You:    "What's the edge on tonight's Sabres game?"
Claude: [loads odds-explorer + edge-detection → pulls live odds from 15+ books,
         compares to your model's probabilities, calculates EV, sizes the bet]
```

## Quick Start

**1. Clone the skills:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PuckAPI/claude-sports-analytics.git
```

**2. Connect live NHL data** (optional — 500 free credits):

```bash
claude mcp add puckapi --transport streamable-http "https://mcp.puckapi.com/mcp?key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<sub>Get your free key at <a href="https://puckapi.com">puckapi.com</a>. Skills also work with your own CSV/JSON files — no API key needed.</sub>

**3. Ask Claude anything:**

```
"Analyze the Maple Leafs' season — record, Corsi, xG, special teams"
"Help me build a game prediction model"
"Show me tonight's odds and flag any line movement"
"Compare McDavid and MacKinnon across every stat"
"Backtest my betting strategy over the last 3 seasons"
```

The `dispatch` skill routes your request to the right 2-3 skills automatically.

## How It Works

Skills are **markdown files, not code**. Each one teaches Claude a specific domain. When you mention a topic, Claude reads the relevant skill and gains that expertise for the conversation.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**What each skill includes:**

- When to use / when NOT to use
- Step-by-step methodology
- Python/pandas code templates
- Anti-patterns it actively prevents
- Chaining to the next logical skill

</td>
<td width="50%">

**What skills prevent:**

- k-fold on time-series data
- Future data leakage in features
- Overfitting to small samples
- Wrong devigging methods
- Misinterpreting advanced stats
