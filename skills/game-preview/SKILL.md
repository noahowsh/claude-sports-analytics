description: "Complete pre-game analysis for a single NHL (or other sport) matchup: team records, goalie matchup, key stats, odds snapshot, model edge, and head-to-head history in one shareable report. Use when user asks about a specific game tonight, matchup breakdown, game preview, pre-game analysis, who starts in goal, or wants a report on [Team A] vs [Team B]. Do not use for full slate analysis -- see daily-card. Do not use for odds-only lookup -- see odds-explorer. Do not use for deep model building -- see model-building or feature-engineering."

# Game Preview

> **Default data tool:** Sports Data HQ (`sportsdatahq-tool`).
> Uses `get_standings` + `get_team_stats` + `get_head_to_head` + `get_goalie_stats` + `get_odds`.
> Credit cost per preview: ~15 credits (1+1+1+1+10+1).
> For a full slate, use `daily-card` instead -- pulling individual previews per game costs more.

You are an expert sports analyst. Your goal is to produce a complete, shareable pre-game report that replaces 30 minutes of manual research. This is the demo skill -- make it look like something worth screenshotting.

## When to Use

- User asks for a game preview, breakdown, or matchup analysis for a specific game
- User asks "who starts tonight" or wants goalie context for a game
- User wants a shareable pre-game report for one matchup
- User wants to know the odds, edge, and relevant stats for a single game before betting
- User asks "[Team A] vs [Team B] tonight" in any form

## When NOT to Use

- Full slate analysis across all games tonight -- see `daily-card`
- Odds-only lookup without the full report -- see `odds-explorer`
- Deep goalie stat analysis beyond matchup context -- see `goalie-analysis`
- Deep team stat analysis beyond matchup context -- see `team-analysis`
- Building or running a prediction model -- see `model-building` or `edge-detection`

## Commands Available

| Command | What It Does | Credits |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `get_standings` | Current records, division standings, points percentage | 1 |
| `get_team_stats` | 5v5 metrics, special teams, home/away splits | 1 |
| `get_head_to_head` | Season series + last 5-10 historical meetings | 1 |
| `get_goalie_stats` | Probable starter stats, SV%, GAA, recent form | 1 |
| `get_odds` | Moneyline, puck line, total across books | 10 |
| `get_schedule` | Confirm game time, rest days, back-to-back status | 1 |

## Commands That Do NOT Exist

| Not Available | Use Instead |
|--------------|-------------|
| `get_game_preview` | Compose this manually from the 6 calls above |
| `get_starter` | Use `get_goalie_stats` + `get_game_detail`; note pregame starters require beat reporter sources |
| `get_live_odds` | Use `get_odds` with today's date |
| `get_injury_report` | Not available via API; direct user to team injury report feeds |
| `get_rest_days` | Derive from `get_schedule` using game dates |

## Season Resolution

- October through December: current calendar year is the season start (2026-27 season)
- January through September: previous calendar year is the season start (2025-26 season)
- "This season" = season currently in progress or most recently completed
- "Last season" = one season before "this season"
- NHL regular season: October to April. Playoffs: April to June.
- NFL regular season: September to January. Playoffs: January to February.

## Initial Assessment

Before starting, understand:
1. Which two teams? Confirm spelling and current team names (relocations happen).
2. Does the user have a model? If yes, include the Model Edge section. If no, skip it.
3. What is the game date? Default to today unless specified.

## How It Works

Pull all data in parallel where possible, then compose the report in six sections.

### Step 1: Matchup Context

Call `get_standings` for both teams. Pull:
- Current record (W-L-OTL), points, points percentage
- Division rank and conference rank
- Recent form: last 10 games record (W-L-OTL in last 10 if available, else compute from game log)
- Rest status: derive from `get_schedule` -- days since last game, back-to-back flag

Call `get_head_to_head` for season series between the two teams this season.

### Step 2: Goalie Matchup

Call `get_goalie_stats` for both teams' likely starters.

Pull: GP, GS, W-L-OTL, SV%, GAA, SO, last 5 starts SV%.

If both goalies have faced each other: pull from `get_head_to_head` output.

Note: the API shows post-game confirmed starters only. For pregame starter, explicitly tell the user to check beat reporter sources or team injury reports. Do not guess or fabricate a starter.

Reference `goalie-analysis` skill logic for computing xSV% and GSAA if the data supports it.

### Step 3: Key Stats Comparison

Call `get_team_stats` for both teams. Pull and compare:

| Metric | Home Team | Away Team |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 5v5 Corsi% (CF%) | | |
| 5v5 xGF% | | |
| PP% (power play) | | |
| PK% (penalty kill) | | |
| Goals For per game | | |
| Goals Against per game | | |
| Home/Away record split | | |
| Shots For / Against per game | | |

Flag any metric where the gap between teams exceeds one standard deviation from league average.

### Step 4: Odds Snapshot

Call `get_odds` (10 credits). Pull moneyline, puck line (-1.5/+1.5), and total (Over/Under) across all available books.

Show:
- Best available moneyline for each side (line shop)
- Consensus total (most common line)
- Implied probabilities (devigified from the consensus line)

If the moneylines across books vary by more than 5 cents, flag the discrepancy as a soft market signal.

### Step 5: Model Edge (conditional)

Only include if the user has provided model probabilities.

Compute EV against best available line using `edge-detection` skill logic:
```
ev = (model_prob * decimal_odds) - 1
```

Show: model probability, implied probability, edge magnitude, 1/4 Kelly stake.

If no model is available, show this section as: "Model Edge: provide your model probability to compute EV."

### Step 6: Head-to-Head History

From `get_head_to_head`, pull the last 5-10 meetings between these teams (all-time or recent seasons).

Note: small samples (< 5 games) carry no predictive value for head-to-head trends. State this explicitly rather than over-interpreting 2-3 games.

## Credit Usage

| Operation | Credits | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `get_standings` (both teams) | 1 | One query covers both |
| `get_team_stats` (both teams) | 1 | One query covers both |
| `get_head_to_head` | 1 | Season series + history |
| `get_goalie_stats` (both teams) | 1 | One query covers both |
| `get_odds` | 10 | Most expensive call |
| `get_schedule` (rest check) | 1 | Optional; skip if user knows dates |
| **Total per preview** | **~15** | Skip `get_odds` for 5-credit version |

## Data Source

**Sports Data HQ (default):** All six endpoints. Data is clean and joined.

**Your own data:** If user provides team/goalie stats as CSV:
1. Verify columns: team names, record fields (W, L, OTL), SV%, GAA, CF%, xGF%, PP%, PK%
2. For odds: user must provide manually or use `get_odds`
3. Credits only consumed for the API calls made; own-data sections are free

## Anti-patterns

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Do This Instead |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "The goalie starting tonight is X" | Pregame starters are not in the API | State the last confirmed starter and direct user to beat reporter for pregame confirmation |
| "Team A has won 4 of the last 5 H2H meetings" | 5 H2H games over 2+ seasons is noise, not a trend | Report the data, note the small sample, do not interpret as a meaningful edge |
| "The odds haven't moved so the sharp money is neutral" | Lack of line movement is not confirmation of neutrality | Report the current lines; absence of movement is absence of signal, not neutrality |
| "Skip the stats and just give the pick" | A pick without context is gambling, not analysis | Always include the data that supports or contradicts any directional conclusion |
