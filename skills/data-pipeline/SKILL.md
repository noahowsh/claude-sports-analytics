# Data Pipeline

> **Default data tool:** Sports Data HQ (`sportsdatahq-tool`).
> Pipeline automation calls the same MCP endpoints used interactively. Daily NHL data pull: `get_games` + `get_odds` = 11 credits per run. Full season backfill: ~1,230 credits for odds.
> For building the prediction model that runs in the pipeline, see `model-building` first.

You are an expert in sports analytics automation. Your goal is to bridge the gap between "I built a model" and "my model runs every morning and I check results over coffee." This is where a school project becomes a system.

## When to Use

- "How do I automate my daily NHL picks?"
- "I want my model to run at 6 AM every morning"
- "How do I set up a GitHub Action for sports data?"
- "How do I track which model version made which prediction?"
- "When should I retrain my model?"
- "How do I detect if my model is drifting?"
- "I want to chain play-by-play + odds + injury data in one pipeline"

## When NOT to Use

- One-time data pulls -- use `sportsdatahq-tool` or `game-lookup` directly
- Building the prediction model itself -- see `model-building`
- Validating a model's historical performance -- see `backtesting`
- Generating a one-time picks card -- see `daily-card`

## Commands Available

This skill does not call data tools directly. It generates pipeline code and configuration.

| Output Type | What It Produces |
|------------|-----------------|
| GitHub Actions YAML | Daily cron job for data pull and prediction generation |
| Python script | Data fetch + prediction generation skeleton |
| SQLite schema | Prediction tracking and actuals logging |
| Drift alert script | Detects accuracy drop or edge compression |
| Retrain trigger | Condition-based model refresh logic |

## Commands That Do NOT Exist

| Not Available | Use Instead |
|--------------|-------------|
| `schedule_pipeline` | Use GitHub Actions cron or system cron via the YAML below |
| `auto_retrain` | Implement retrain trigger logic manually (see Retrain Triggers section) |
| `get_injuries` | Injury data not available via `sportsdatahq-tool`; integrate a separate source |
| `stream_live_data` | MCP is pull-only; schedule frequent polls instead of streaming |

## Initial Assessment

Before building the pipeline, understand:

1. **What does the pipeline need to produce?** Predictions only, or predictions + picks + reports?
2. **How often does it run?** Daily (most common), before each game window, or event-driven?
3. **Where do predictions get stored?** SQLite (local), Postgres, Google Sheets, or Notion?
4. **Does the model already exist?** If not, build it first via `model-building`.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Define the pipeline shape

The standard sports analytics pipeline has four stages:

```
[Schedule] -> [Data Pull] -> [Prediction] -> [Storage + Alert]
      |              |              |                |
   Cron job    sportsdatahq-   Your model      SQLite /
   6 AM daily   tool API       .predict()      Sheets / API
```

### Step 2: Set up the GitHub Actions cron

The daily NHL pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/daily-nhl-pipeline.yml
name: Daily NHL Pipeline

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 11 * * *'  # 6 AM ET = 11:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:       # Manual trigger for testing

jobs:
  run-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Pull today's games
        env:
          SPORTSDATAHQ_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SPORTSDATAHQ_API_KEY }}
        run: python scripts/pull_games.py --date today

      - name: Pull odds
        env:
          SPORTSDATAHQ_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SPORTSDATAHQ_API_KEY }}
        run: python scripts/pull_odds.py --date today

      - name: Generate predictions
        run: python scripts/generate_predictions.py --date today

      - name: Log predictions to SQLite
        run: python scripts/log_predictions.py --date today

      - name: Check for drift alert
        run: python scripts/drift_check.py --window 14

      - name: Commit results
        run: |
          git config --global user.email "pipeline@yourdomain.com"
          git config --global user.name "Pipeline Bot"
          git add data/ predictions/
          git commit -m "Daily pipeline: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" || echo "Nothing to commit"
          git push
```

**Time to schedule:** NHL games are typically announced by noon ET. Run at 6 AM ET to catch morning lines, then again at noon to refresh odds before evening games if needed.

### Step 3: Data pull script skeleton

```python
# scripts/pull_games.py
import argparse
import json
import os
from datetime import date, timedelta
import requests  # or your MCP client

def pull_games(target_date: str):
    """Pull today's NHL games from Sports Data HQ MCP."""
    api_key = os.environ["SPORTSDATAHQ_API_KEY"]
    
    # Call get_games endpoint (1 credit)
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.sportsdatahq.com/mcp",
        json={
            "tool": "get_games",
            "params": {
                "sport": "nhl",
                "date": target_date
            }
        },
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
    )
    
    games = response.json()["games"]
    
    # Save raw data with timestamp
    output_path = f"data/games/{target_date}.json"
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(output_path), exist_ok=True)
    with open(output_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump({
            "date": target_date,
            "pulled_at": date.today().isoformat(),
            "games": games
        }, f, indent=2)
    
    print(f"Pulled {len(games)} games for {target_date}")
    return games

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--date", default="today")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    target = date.today().isoformat() if args.date == "today" else args.date
    pull_games(target)
```

```python
# scripts/generate_predictions.py
import argparse
import json
import pickle
from datetime import date

def generate_predictions(target_date: str):
    """Load model and generate predictions for today's games."""
    # Load the versioned model
    model_version = get_active_model_version()
    with open(f"models/{model_version}/model.pkl", "rb") as f:
        model = pickle.load(f)
    
    # Load today's games + features
    with open(f"data/games/{target_date}.json") as f:
        games_data = json.load(f)
    
    with open(f"data/odds/{target_date}.json") as f:
        odds_data = json.load(f)
    
    predictions = []
    for game in games_data["games"]:
        features = build_features(game, odds_data)
        home_win_prob = model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]
        
        predictions.append({
            "game_id": game["id"],
            "date": target_date,
            "home_team": game["home_team"],
            "away_team": game["away_team"],
            "home_win_prob": round(home_win_prob, 4),
            "model_version": model_version,
            "generated_at": date.today().isoformat()
        })
    
    output_path = f"predictions/{target_date}.json"
    with open(output_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(predictions, f, indent=2)
    
    print(f"Generated {len(predictions)} predictions with model {model_version}")
    return predictions

def get_active_model_version() -> str:
    """Read the active model version from the registry."""
    with open("models/registry.json") as f:
        registry = json.load(f)
    return registry["active"]

def build_features(game: dict, odds_data: dict) -> list:
    """Build feature vector for one game. Implement your feature engineering here."""
    # Replace with your actual feature engineering
    raise NotImplementedError("Implement build_features with your model's inputs")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--date", default="today")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    from datetime import date as d
    target = d.today().isoformat() if args.date == "today" else args.date
    generate_predictions(target)
```

### Step 4: SQLite prediction tracking schema

```sql
-- predictions.db schema

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS predictions (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    game_id         TEXT NOT NULL,
    game_date       DATE NOT NULL,
    home_team       TEXT NOT NULL,
    away_team       TEXT NOT NULL,
    home_win_prob   REAL NOT NULL,         -- Model probability
    model_version   TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Version that made this prediction
    generated_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    opening_odds    REAL,                  -- Market odds at prediction time
    closing_odds    REAL,                  -- Line at game time (fill later)
    actual_result   INTEGER,               -- 1 = home win, 0 = away win (fill after game)
    notes           TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS model_versions (
    version         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    trained_at      DATE NOT NULL,
    training_games  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    val_accuracy    REAL NOT NULL,
    val_auc         REAL NOT NULL,
    feature_set     TEXT NOT NULL,         -- JSON list of features
    is_active       INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    notes           TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS drift_log (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    check_date      DATE NOT NULL,
    window_days     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    games_in_window INTEGER NOT NULL,
    accuracy        REAL NOT NULL,
    expected_acc    REAL NOT NULL,
    drift_flag      INTEGER DEFAULT 0,     -- 1 if alert triggered
    notes           TEXT
);

-- Useful query: rolling 14-day accuracy
SELECT 
    game_date,
    AVG(CASE WHEN actual_result = ROUND(home_win_prob) THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) 
        OVER (ORDER BY game_date ROWS BETWEEN 13 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_14d_acc
FROM predictions
WHERE actual_result IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY game_date;
```

### Step 5: Model versioning

```python
# models/registry.json -- update manually or via script after training
{
    "active": "v2.1.0",
    "versions": [
        {
            "version": "v1.0.0",
            "trained": "2025-10-01",
            "val_accuracy": 0.563,
            "features": ["cf_pct", "pdo", "rest_days"],
            "retired": "2025-12-15"
        },
        {
            "version": "v2.0.0",
            "trained": "2025-12-15",
            "val_accuracy": 0.571,
            "features": ["cf_pct", "xgf_pct", "pdo", "rest_days", "h2h_last5"],
            "retired": "2026-01-20"
        },
        {
            "version": "v2.1.0",
            "trained": "2026-01-20",
            "val_accuracy": 0.579,
            "features": ["cf_pct", "xgf_pct", "pdo", "rest_days", "h2h_last5", "back_to_back"],
            "is_active": true
        }
    ]
}
```

**Versioning rule:** Never overwrite a model file. Each `train_model.py` run outputs a new version directory: `models/v2.2.0/model.pkl`. Update `registry.json` to promote it to active.

### Step 6: Retrain triggers

When to retrain (pick the condition that fits your workflow):

| Condition | Trigger | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Calendar-based | Monthly, on the 1st | Run `train_model.py` with last 2 seasons of data |
| Game count | Every 50 new games | Rolling window retrain |
| Accuracy drop | 14-day accuracy falls below (expected - 3pp) | Urgent retrain + review feature importance |
| New season | October 1st | Full retrain on completed season |
| Line movement | Average CLV drops below 0% for 30 days | Model is predicting the line, not beating it |

**Do not retrain** on a bad week alone. Variance kills accurate-but-unlucky models. Require 2-3 consecutive trigger conditions before retraining mid-season.

### Step 7: Drift alerting

```python
# scripts/drift_check.py
import sqlite3
import argparse

DRIFT_THRESHOLD = 0.03  # Alert if accuracy drops 3pp below expected

def check_drift(window_days: int = 14):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("predictions.db")
    
    query = """
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) as games,
            AVG(CASE WHEN actual_result = ROUND(home_win_prob) THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as accuracy
        FROM predictions
        WHERE actual_result IS NOT NULL
          AND game_date >= DATE('now', '-{} days')
    """.format(window_days)
    
    result = conn.execute(query).fetchone()
    games, accuracy = result
    
    # Load expected accuracy from active model's validation score
    expected_acc = get_expected_accuracy()
    
    drift_detected = accuracy < (expected_acc - DRIFT_THRESHOLD)
    
    conn.execute("""
        INSERT INTO drift_log (check_date, window_days, games_in_window, accuracy, expected_acc, drift_flag)
        VALUES (DATE('now'), ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    """, (window_days, games, accuracy, expected_acc, int(drift_detected)))
    conn.commit()
    
    if drift_detected:
        print(f"DRIFT ALERT: {window_days}-day accuracy {accuracy:.1%} vs expected {expected_acc:.1%}")
        print(f"Games in window: {games}. Consider retraining if this persists.")
        # Optionally: send email, Slack message, or GitHub issue
    else:
        print(f"No drift detected: {window_days}-day accuracy {accuracy:.1%} (expected {expected_acc:.1%})")

def get_expected_accuracy() -> float:
    import json
    with open("models/registry.json") as f:
        registry = json.load(f)
    active = registry["active"]
    for v in registry["versions"]:
        if v["version"] == active:
            return v["val_accuracy"]
    return 0.55  # Fallback

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--window", type=int, default=14)
    args = parser.parse_args()
    check_drift(args.window)
```

### Step 8: Multi-source MCP orchestration

When chaining play-by-play + odds + team stats in one pipeline run:

```python
# scripts/pull_all_sources.py
import asyncio

async def pull_all_data(target_date: str):
    """Pull from multiple sources in parallel. Fail gracefully on any source."""
    
    tasks = [
        pull_games(target_date),          # 1 credit
        pull_odds(target_date),            # 10 credits per game
        pull_team_stats(target_date),      # 1 credit per team
    ]
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    games, odds, team_stats = results
    
    # Graceful degradation: proceed even if one source fails
    if isinstance(odds, Exception):
        print(f"WARNING: Odds pull failed: {odds}. Proceeding without odds data.")
        odds = {}
    
    if isinstance(team_stats, Exception):
        print(f"WARNING: Team stats pull failed: {team_stats}. Using cached stats.")
        team_stats = load_cached_team_stats()
    
    return games, odds, team_stats
```

**Credit cost for a full daily NHL run:**
- `get_games` (today's slate): 1 credit
- `get_odds` (per game, ~12 games/day average): 120 credits
- `get_team_stats` (per team, 32 teams): 32 credits
- **Total: ~153 credits per day | ~56,000 per full season**

Consider caching team stats (update weekly, not daily) to cut this to ~11 credits/day for games + odds only.

## Anti-patterns

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Do This Instead |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "I'll just run the script manually each morning" | You'll miss days, break the streak, and lose comparable data | Set up the cron/Actions now, even if imperfect |
| "I'll overwrite the model file each time I retrain" | Lose the ability to audit which model made which prediction | Version every model, update registry.json to promote |
| "Drift means I need to retrain immediately" | One bad week is variance, not drift | Require 14-day window AND 3pp drop before acting |
| "I'll track predictions in a spreadsheet" | Manual entry breaks, doesn't scale, no query layer | SQLite takes 30 minutes to set up, lasts forever |
| "I'll pull full season odds every day for backtesting" | 1,230+ credits for historical odds; wasteful if you already have them | Backfill once, store locally, pull only new games daily |

## Credit Usage

| Operation | Credits | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Daily games pull | 1 | One `get_games` call |
| Daily odds (per game) | 10 | Average 12 NHL games/day = 120 credits |
| Team stats (32 teams) | 32 | Cache weekly, not daily |
| Line movement check | 25 | Per game; use sparingly |
| Full season historical odds backfill | ~1,230 | 123 regular season games x 10 credits |

## What to Do Next

| What You Found | Next Action | Skill |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Pipeline is built and running | Automate your daily picks output | `daily-card` |
| Model accuracy is drifting | Audit recent predictions against actuals | `backtesting` |
| Drift confirmed, need to improve features | Re-engineer features with updated data | `feature-engineering` |
| Want to retrain the model | Full model rebuild with new training data | `model-building` |
| Want to track edge compression over time | Compare model probability vs. closing line | `edge-detection` |
